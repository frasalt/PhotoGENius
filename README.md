A basic library for generating photorealistic images,
developed for the course 
[*Numerical techniques for photorealistic image generation*](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2022/numerical-tecniques-photorealistic-image-generation)
held by professor [Maurizio Tomasi](https://github.com/ziotom78) (University of Milan, 2021-2022).

Main contributors: [Francesca Salteri](https://github.com/frasalt) (owner), [Teresa Lamorte](https://github.com/lellalamo), [Martino Zanetti](https://github.com/martinozanetti).

## Features

This library is meant to **render photorealistic images**, given an input txt file containing user instructions.
The user can assemble different images to generate short animations, thanks to a simple *bash script*.

Besides that, it's also possible to **convert HDR images to LDR** (from PFM format to PNG).

Image rendering can be performed via four different backwords raytracing algorithms (onoff, flat, pathtracer, pointlight tracer).
The user can add three types of geometric shapes to the scene (sphere, plane and cylinder), set their color properties 
and camera position, orientation and projection (orthogonal or perspective).

For further information, see the [Application Program Interface](PGENLib.Doc/API.txt)
info file.

## Usage
Extremely easy basic usage.\
\
In PhotoGENius\PhotoGENius directory:\
to **convert file**, type
```bash
dotnet run PhotoGENius pfm2png --input-pfm PFM_FILE_PATH <options>
```
Pay attention that if your computer is set on Italian language, you may need to write floating-point parameters with a comma instead of a dot (e.g. 1,3 instead of 1.3).

To **generate demo image**, type
```bash
dotnet run PhotoGENius render <options>
```
In this case, the scene content is set in an *input txt file*, like [this self-explained one](InputSceneFiles/SELF_EXPLAINED.txt) in the [example directory](InputSceneFiles). \
Type ```-?``` as option to show further usage information.

## Examples

### PFM to PGN convertion
Luminosity factor =10 and gamma compression =0.1 :
```bash
dotnet run -- pfm2png '# use converter' \
           --lum-fac 10 \
           --gamma-fac 0.1 \
           --input-pfm ../Media/Readme_imgs/memorial.pfm '# input file path' \
           --output-png ../Media/Readme_imgs/prova1.png '# output file path'
 ```
![](Media/Readme_imgs/prova1.png)

Luminosity factor =0.01 and gamma compression =2 :
```bash
dotnet run -- pfm2png '# use converter' \
           --lum-fac 0.01 \
           --gamma-fac 2 \
           --input-pfm ../Media/Readme_imgs/memorial.pfm '# input file path' \
           --output-png ../Media/Readme_imgs/prova2.png '# output file path'
 ```

### Generate a brief animation

To **generate frames**, in ```PhotoGENius/BashScripts``` directory, run [this script](BashScripts/generate-frames.sh):
```bash
./generate-frames.sh
```
It takes in input a series of input scene files which must be located in ```InputSceneFiles/serial```,
and be named ```inputNNN.txt``` where ```NNN``` stands for a 3 digits integer. \
Automatic generation of the scene files can be done e.g. via a python program (or write them by hand, if you prefer...).

You can quite easily adapt the script to your needs and make it executable if necessary (chmod +x on Linux and MacOS).

To **assemble video**, after installing [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html), type
```bash
./generate-video.sh
```

## Installation

### Dependencies

A C++ compiler is needed (C++14 or higher).

You also need to install the following dependencies:
- [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.12 or higher);
- [GD library](https://libgd.github.io/) (version 2.3.0 or higher).

If you want to parallelize the execution or run animations, the required dependencies are:
- [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (version 4.4 or higher)

> *Note*: they are not needed for running the raytracing code.

### Download latest release
You can download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/ElisaLegnani/PhotorealisticRendering/releases/tag/v1.1.0) (version 1.1.0) and then unpack it running in the command line (Linux):

```sh
tar -xvf PhotorealisticRendering-1.0.0.tar
```
The command is ```tar xopf``` for MacOS.

### Install from git repository

You can also clone this repository through the command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ElisaLegnani/PhotorealisticRendering.git
```

### Compile

In order to build and compile the code, run the following commands:

```sh
cd PhotorealisticRendering
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Executables files can be found in the `build` directory.

### Testing

Tests are being implemented in the `test` directory.

In order to test the code, run in the `build` directory:

```sh
ctest
```
The testing interface is built using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

## Usage

You can run the program through the script `raytracer`, located in the `build` directory.

The code implements two features, that you can call with commands:
- üåÖ `render`: creates a photorealistic image;
- üîÑ `hdr2ldr`: converts HDR image to LDR.

The basic usage is the following:

```sh
./raytracer [COMMAND] [INPUT_FILENAME] {OPTIONS}

```
The `[INPUT_FILENAME]` is required. There are some examples in the `examples` directory if you want to give it a try or play with the code.

To have more information about available `{OPTIONS}`, a commmand-line help shows more details about program features and parameters:

```sh
./raytracer --help

```

The command line interface is built using the argument parsing library [Taywee/args](https://github.com/Taywee/args).
